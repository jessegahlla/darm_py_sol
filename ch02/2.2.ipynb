    "\n",
    "(b) The actual and theoretical standard deviations from (a) differ, of course. Is this difference statistically significant? (Hint: under the randomness model, the actual variance should have a distribution with expected value equal to the theoretical variance, and proportional to a Ï‡2 with 23 degrees of freedom.)"
